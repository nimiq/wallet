# Nimiq Wallet

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

If you need to interact with a real account and data, then you will also need to run the [Nimiq Hub](https://github.com/nimiq/hub#contribute) and [Nimiq Keyguard](https://github.com/nimiq/keyguard/#development) in development, too.

Otherwise, you can use activate the `demo` mode by appending `?demo` in the URL: `http://localhost:8081/?demo`.
