# Nimiq Wallet

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

If you need to interact with a real account and data, then you will also need to run the [Nimiq Hub](https://github.com/nimiq/hub#contribute) and [Nimiq Keyguard](https://github.com/nimiq/keyguard/#development) in development, too.

For demo mode with simulated accounts and transactions, use:
```
yarn serve:demo
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```
